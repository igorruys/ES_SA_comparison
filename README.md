# ES and SA Comparison

Comparison between the Evolution Strategy (ES) and the Simulated Annealing (SA) optimization algorithms.

For the comparison, we use as metrics the SR (Success Rate), MBF (Mean Best Fitness) and AES (Average number of evaluations to the solution) metrics.

For the ES, different types of crossover and two types of survivor selection (fittest sons and fittest (sons + parents)) were tested.

The algorithms were compared in the context of a clustering problem with 16 clusters.
